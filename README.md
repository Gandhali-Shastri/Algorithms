Algorithms

Longest common sub-sequence- Program to compute the longest common sub-sequence of two sequences in two different ways: Longest common sub-sequence and Longest common strictly increasing sub-sequence.

Gomory-Hu Cut tree - Program to determine a cut tree for an undirected graph. The cut tree is to be found using the algorithm MGH on p. 152 of http://epubs.siam.org.ezproxy.uta.edu/doi/abs/10.1137/0219009 . This technique uses a max-flow, min-cut implementation as an “oracle”. The output cut tree, the smallest capacity on the unique path between vertices s and t gives the capacity of the minimum cut when s and t are used as the source and sink for a network flow algorithm.

longest common substring- The program is used to find the Longest Common Substring for three strings using suffix array and Longest Common Prefix.
